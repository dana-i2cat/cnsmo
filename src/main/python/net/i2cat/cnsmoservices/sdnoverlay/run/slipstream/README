This directory contains the set of scripts SlipStream runs to deploy the SDN. Currently,
the SDN requieres a version of Ubuntu 14.04 in order to run properly. We are planning to widen the
compatibility requirements in the future.

SlipStream defines the following phases which are run in this order in each VM:
pre-install, install, post-install, deployment and reporting.

About the scripts:
sdn-client-postinstall.sh is meant to run in the sdn-client VM at post-install phase.
sdn-client-deployment.sh is meant to run in the sdn-client VM at deployment phase, after post-install.
sdn-client-deployment.py is executed by sdn-client-deployment.sh. It contains the deployment instructions.
sdn-server-postinstall.sh is meant to run in the sdn-server VM at post-install phase.
sdn-server-deployment.sh is meant to run in the sdn-server VM at deployment phase, after post-install.
sdn-server-deployment.py is executed by sdn-server-deployment.sh. It contains the deployment instructions.
